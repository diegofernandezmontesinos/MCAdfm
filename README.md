# Project created with vite

# dependecies 

npm install react-slider
npm add @babel/runtime
npm i -D react-router-dom



This project is made for MCA, the main funtion is to show the range slider and the range slider with fixed values.

For time issue, I didn't use in this case bootstrap or semantic UI, but it could be cool for the future.

There project doidn't ask to create a landing page, however I thought it could be wonderful to show a landingpage where user could select between the two sliders to see the exercises. Both pages (exercise1 and exercise2 have a return button to go back).

I hope you like it and enjoy it.
